# Simulation using twas_sim and Snakemake

* `Snakemake` - provides all code used to run simulation and the
  methods evaluated
* `final_plot.R` - code used to make Figure 2 and Supplementary
  Figures of simulation performance metrics
* `null_plot.R` - code used to assess the 3 null simulation settings
* `mrlocus.R`, `twmr.R`, `pmr_summary_egger.R`, `lda_mr_egger.R` - for
  R-based methods, the usage of the R functions are provided in these
  files
* `sim_review.R` - code used for making the diagram explaining the simulations
* `timing.R` - code used for making the timing plot
