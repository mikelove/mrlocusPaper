* [public](https://github.com/mikelove/mrlocusPaper/tree/master/public) - code for the public (real) dataset analyses
* [sim](https://github.com/mikelove/mrlocusPaper/tree/master/sim) - code for the simulation setup, analysis, and evaluations

See `README.md` files within each directory for more details. `supp`
and `methods` directories contain the Latex files for the
Supplementary Tables and Figures, and the Supplementary Methods,
respectively. The files containing the seeds and parameter settings
for the 440 `twas_sim` simulations are located in 
`/sim/revision_1/simulation_files_440_rev1.tgz`.

The [MRLocus](https://mikelove.github.io/mrlocus) software is in a
